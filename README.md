# üõ†Ô∏è Challenge 3 Solution - Build a highly available web application with Terraform

This branch holds the solution code. If you're here you are either stuck, finished and looking to compare code, or simply want to skip the challenge and deploy this code instead. Note this code is not modularized as I wanted to keep it flat for the final challenge so it would be easier to look at and troubleshoot. This code is very similar to the other code you've analyzed, it has an application load balancer and some additional resources that are required. If your code doesn't look exactly like this - that's okay. If you used a different type of load balancer or ended up changing the deployment, that is also okay. As long as what you have works. Th real end goal is to have (2) web servers in different availability zones displaying a landing.html page that sit behind a load balancer
